ChatBoot AI is an open-source platform designed to help developers build and deploy conversational AI models more efficiently. 
The platform consists of three main components:

* OpenAPI Contract: An OpenAPI YAML file defining a set of APIs that outline the functionality and data structures required for a chatbot to interact with users. This contract provides a standardized way of building and deploying chatbots.
* Front-end: The user-facing interface that allows developers to build and test their chatbots using pre-built templates and UI elements.
* Backends: Written in several languages (Java, JavaScript, TypeScript...) these are the actual chatbot implementations that can be used to integrate with popular platforms. Developers can choose from pre-built backends for different programming languages, making it easier to build and deploy their chatbots across various platforms.

The platform also provides a set of examples for developers to get inspiration in developing their chatbots.
ChatBoot AI aims to make it easier for developers to create conversational AI applications.
By providing a standardized platform for building chatbots, ChatBoot AI hopes to accelerate the development of conversational AI and make it more accessible to a broader range of developers.
